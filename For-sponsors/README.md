# For my Patreon patreons/sponsors

This file contains general info on donations, where the money goes to, and other info.

## Donations

Any donation amount will do. Unfortunately, the minimum I could set was $3.00 a month. If there was a way for just a penny a month for people who wanted to do so, I would have done that. Please specify what you would like your money to go to when donating. The following funds can be donated to:

* CompuSmell research - My project on giving computers the ability to output various odors, giving a more immersive experience

* Autism research and support (UAR) - My project raising awareness of what Autism is like, and helping people with Autism

* Useful tip for images (Image projects) - For when you like my image projects enough to donate to their continued existance. Money will go for keeping the images up, and promoting them

* Journaling project - Supporting my life archive project

* Personal hardware projects - When you want to donate to help keep my personal hardware (laptop, external hard drives, headphones, keyboard, etc.) functional

* Public hardware projects - When you want to support hardware projects, such as my super-power user laptop idea (extremely powerful laptop that you can choose whatever Linux distribution you want to be intalled by default. With hardware so powerful, it can make gaming laptops a legitimate thing) and the Reactop product line (a series of laptops running ReactOS, with dualboot options for Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, (but not 10) (although Windows currently isn't installed by default at the moment))

* Food index - Support my fight against Nestle, and possibly my eating habits (donations currently aren't really needed here)

* SNU development - Support my suite of website tools and pages for the future social media site to be the ultimate alternative to YouTube, Twitter, Tumblr, P###hub, Pinterest, Reddit, Giphy, Instagram, Facebook, and thousands upon thousands of other sites

* Malware - For support against possible litigation of my malware for people who didn't read the main instruction and ran it outside a virtual machine
