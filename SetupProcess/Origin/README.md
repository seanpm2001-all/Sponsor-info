# Origin of Patreon account

On July 20th 2020, I created a Patreon account to test the sponsor button on GitHub, and receive donations for projects. I wasn't able to fully set up for a while, and activity remained low for a very long time.

On [March 13th 2021](/SetupProcess/March14th2021/AccountSetupStatus_March14th2021.md), I finished the setup process, other than adding a payment method.
