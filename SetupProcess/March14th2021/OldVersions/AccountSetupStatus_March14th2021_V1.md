# Account setup status March 14th 2021

I actually finished setup on March 13th 2021. [See Patreon account before March 13th 2021](/SetupProcess/Origin/README.md)

On March 13th 2021, I finished setup of my Patreon account (other than adding a payment method, along with some other steps. There are now some errors I am working on fixing:

* Originally, I linked to the Patreon page `seanpm2001` which is my personal page, and not my donation page. This will need to be fixed in several repositories

* Some day 1 issues on March 14th 2021 during sponsor button setup was typing `seanpm2001-software` or `seanpm2001software` instead of the correct `seanpm2001_software` I feel like I fixed all instances of this issue on the same day

Next I need to get a [Payment method set up](/SetupProcess/March15th2021/PaymentMethod.md).
