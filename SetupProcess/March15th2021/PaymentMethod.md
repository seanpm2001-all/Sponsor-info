# March 15th Patreon payment method decision

I recently set up my Patreon account completely after a delay from July 20th 2020 [(See this file for further info on this)](SetupProcess/March14th2021/Setup_March14th2021.md)

This setup process and the research involved made me start learning about the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) and its processes. I eventually found my way to 2 payment methods: PayPal or Stripe

PayPal has an incredibly bad history, and I have heard many bad things about the service, and I feel like it is a scam, even on Patreon, taking 20% of my donation revenue. I am leaning towards stripe, as they have a much better history. The only thing that may be sketchy is that Ireland is a known tax haven, and I don't know enough about them. I am still making the decision, I am leaning heavily towards stripe due to the $0.25 takeout, the better reputation, and unconventially, ties to my Irish heritage.

I am only given these 2 options for Patreon. Currently (as of March 15th 2021) here is how I feel:

Which one is a better choice?

**PayPal:** `2.3%`

**Stripe:** `97.7%`

**This is still an active decision. Please provide info when possible.**
